## Grid
Grid system utilize simple 2d [ x,y ] matrix to handle map and object placements

## Mapping unit
There's 16 pixel for every block on the map. Mind that with character spritesheet, it's 2x2 block per sprite so it's 32 pixel per character sprite.

## Grid Utils
- **widthGrid** returns calculated pixel units
- **asGridCoord** returns an array with its calculated cordinate
